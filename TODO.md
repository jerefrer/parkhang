# TODO

* Add unbreakable groups (for Om Ah Hung mantra for instance)
* Remove the bar at the beginning of a group if it starts on a new page with a yigo
* Find out what would be the best way to handle the spaces between groups

# Ideas

* Add the possibility of a custom modal message when starting a practice (remember this before starting)
* Add the possibility to place markers with comments between groups and/or on groups/syllables

# Keep in mind

* Use & instead of "and" if space is missing. Make it automatic?
* Don't move Tibetan small writings after a prayer but rather just move the translation before.

# Cases to check

* When the last cell of a tibetan line is very thin, what happens with the translation?
