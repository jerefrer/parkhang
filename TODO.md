# TODO

* For now smallWritings that span two pages are handled properly, but not if they are longer. Fix that.
* Test break-word property
* Proper sizes for pechas and make everything fit
* Proper font-sizes for A4/A5 according to Padmakara booklets
* Styling for split pages headers
* Index with links
* Add phonetics option for pechas
* Make phonetics optional for split pages?
* Add unbreakable groups (for Om Ah Hung mantra for instance)
* Remove the bar at the beginning of a group if it starts on a new page with a yigo

# Existential questions

* What would be the best way to handle the spaces between groups?
* Does there have to be two bars between two groups?
* Why sometimes only one after the end and none at the beginning?

# Ideas

* Add the possibility of a custom modal message when starting a practice (remember this before starting)
* Add the possibility to place markers with comments between groups and/or on groups/syllables

# Keep in mind

* Use & instead of "and" if space is missing. Make it automatic?
* Don't move Tibetan small writings after a prayer but rather just move the translation before.
